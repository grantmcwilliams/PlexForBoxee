plexforboxee - A Plex Client for Boxee
================================
Originally created by xmcnuggetx

Made available on GitHub by Grant McWilliams - thanks!

The code is currently quite buggy - but the core functionality works.

The only option is a manual install at present as the app is in development.
Once the app is in better shape it will be posted to a boxee app repository.

Manual Install Instructions
---------------------------
*Option 1*
* If you have root access to your Boxee (via Boxee+hacks - boxeeplus.com) - copy the plexee app into /data/.boxee/UserData/apps

*Option 2*
* If you have a closed device - then you'll need to get a developers certificate for your device.
* Login to your boxee account at http://www.boxee.tv
* Go to the Developer section and follow the process to get a certificate

* Copy the certificate into a folder name BoxeeApps on the root of a usb stick/drive
* Copy the plexee folder into BoxeeApps as well
* Attach the usb stick/drive to the Boxee device - the plexee application should now be available under Favourites in Apps.
